      <p class="text">Surrealism aimed to transcend the realist depiction of scenes available to ordinary perception.
        Under the influence of the new discipline of psychoanalysis, surrealists made use of such techniques as dream analysis to
        uncover the unconscious workings of the mind and the symbols that the unconscious works with. Not much of
        Magritte's oeuvre consists of literally inconsistent images, but at least one famous image does, <strong>The Blank Signature</strong>.</p>
      <p class="text">This painting utilizes a technique like that of the <em>"Schuster fork"</em>, and illustrates how the mind
        constructs the impossibility. The mind puts together the separate elements into a "coherent" whole of these parts. The horse is
        thus bisected by a patch of background grass. Also, one of the tree trunks is in front of the horse but its base
        is behind the horse. It certainly seems that these elements are inconsistent with our conception of a rider in
        a forest. For example, it qualifies as an occlusion illusion, since reversal of occlusions is sufficient to produce a consistent image.</p>
      <p class="text">What I think is really fascinating is that such a disorienting image was created by only essentially altering two
        panels, the tree behind the woman and the background in the middle. It’s just those two elements that completely
        screw with our brains. It’s brilliant and simple at the same time.</p>
